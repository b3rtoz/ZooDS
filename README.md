# ZooDS

ZooDS is a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for automotive diagnostic applications. It leverages the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol to provide a suite of diagnostic functionalities for vehicle systems.

## Features

- **UDS Session Management:** Initiate and maintain diagnostic sessions.
- **Service Execution:** Send UDS diagnostic commands for various services.
- **Data Scanning:** Retrieve diagnostic data for in-depth vehicle analysis.
- **Tester Present:** Send periodic messages to keep diagnostic sessions active.
- **Extensible Commands:** Easily add new diagnostic operations based on your needs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or later

## Installation

You can install ZooDS into your environment using pip. If you haven't already, make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

```bash
pip install zooDS
```

Alternatively, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b3rtoz/zooDS.git
cd zooDS

```

## Usage

After installation, you can run ZooDS from the command line. Below is an example of how to execute a basic diagnostic command:

```bash
